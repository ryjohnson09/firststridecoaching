Depending on what you're training for, you could be out on a run for 1, 2, maybe even 3+ hours. When there's not much to look at, long runs can get boring fast. Or maybe you just need a distraction to get you through a tough workout.

I'm not a huge fan of running with my clunky phone, unless I have a running vest on. I also prefer to keep things as minimal as possible. I've spent 5 years trying to find the perfect music player/headphone combination, and I'm excited to share my findings! I'll also share my "runner up" music setup.

## Garmin Forerunner 965

5 years ago, my current music running setup wasn't possible. But now, many GPS running watches have music/podcast storage and bluetooth pairing with headphones. It's not cheap, but I currently run with the [Garmin Forerunner 965](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/which-watch/athlete/option2/2/). I use the Spotify app within Garmin Connect to add custom playlists and podcasts to my watch before I head out for a run. Once it's configured, you can add Spotify playlists/podcasts all from the watch interface.

## Shokz OpenRun

You should always be aware of your surroundings when running, which is why I currently run with [OpenRun bone conducting headphones from Shokz](https://shokz.com/products/openrun). These pair beautifully with my watch and allow me to hear the world around me in addition to my music. The battery life is solid; I've only ran out of juice during my ultra-marathons (5+ hours). If you do decide to use your phone instead of your watch, you can also take calls with these headphones.

## Runner Up

There used to be a popular iPod perfect for running called the iPod Shuffle. If you're looking for something similar in the post-iPod era, then check out [Mighty](https://bemighty.com/). It worked well with the openrun headphones, and easily clips onto your shirt/shorts. I used the Mighty for about a year, and my only negative feedback is that without a screen, it can sometime be challenging to pair and sync songs with your phone.

Happy Running!!
