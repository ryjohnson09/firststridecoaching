But now, many GPS running watches have music/podcast storage and bluetooth pairing with headphones. It’s not cheap, but I currently run with the Garmin Forerunner 965. I use the Spotify app within Garmin Connect to add custom playlists and podcasts to my watch before I head out for a run. Once it’s configured, you can add Spotify playlists/podcasts all from the watch interface."

These pair beautifully with my watch and allow me to hear the world around me in addition to my music. The battery life is solid; I’ve only ran out of juice during my ultra-marathons (5+ hours). If you do decide to use your phone instead of your watch, you can also take calls with these headphones."

It worked well with the openrun headphones, and easily clips onto your shirt/shorts. I used the Mighty for about a year, and my only negative feedback is that without a screen, it can sometime be challenging to pair and sync songs with your phone.\nHappy Running!!\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
